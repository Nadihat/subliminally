This fork:
1. Stubs video maker as it was deemed unnecessary
2. Precreates the .files and subliminals/audios directories
3. Makes the image argument optional (as it's unnecessary now)
4. Unversions the dependencies to fix bitrot
as well as adds an experimental babble_maker.py, that uses pydub and may be very effective, perhaps even more so than this project.

## Introduction

Subliminally is program  written with Python designed to make creating subliminal audios as easy as possible.


### How does it work?

Subliminally requests four different inputs: the main affirmations, the booster affirmations, an image file, and an audio file (e.g. a song of choice). <br>
These four inputs are then elaborated using a pretty simple algorithm. Here a pretty simplified version of the main algorithm:

<br>

The algorithm behind the creation of the subliminal audio is the most important one. Here it is:

<br>
<i>affs is the affirmations audio file; bg is the background audio file; affs_length and bg_length are the duration (in seconds) of the respective audio files.</i>

<br>

## Getting started

Subliminally has two different versions:
- the <b>graphical user interface</b> (GUI) version;
- the <b>command line interface</b> (CLI) version.

Let's see the differences between the two:
| CLI | GUI |
|:---:|:---:|
| Maybe harder to use for beginners. | It is generally easier to use. |
| It is faster. | It is much slower. |
| Affirmations must be written in a file, before running the script. | Affirmations can be written while the program is running. |

### Installation

#### CLI version

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/marihere/subliminally
$ cd subliminally
$ python .\lib\main.py
```

#### GUI version

The GUI version can be found [here](https://github.com/marihere/subliminally_gui).

## Usage

```console
$ python .\lib\main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] -t TITLE -a AFFS -b BG -i IMG

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TITLE, --title TITLE
                        title for your subliminal
  -a AFFS, --affs AFFS  text file of the affirmations for your subliminal
  -b BG, --bg BG        audio file for your subliminal
  -i IMG, --img IMG     image file for your subliminal
```

<br>

## Example

```console
$ python .\lib\main.py --title mysubliminal --affs .\example\affirmations.txt --bg .\example\rainfall_sounds.wav --img .\example\image.jpg
```
